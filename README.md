# Denial-of-Service Attack Detection using Machine Learning in Network-on-Chip Architectures

## Abstract

State-of-the-art System-on-Chip (SoC) designs consist of many Intellectual Property (IP) cores that interact using a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture. SoC designers increasingly rely on global supply chains for obtaining third-party IPs. In addition to inherent vulnerabilities associated with utilizing thirdparty IPs, NoC based SoCs enable attackers to exploit the distributed nature of NoC and its connectivity with various IPs to launch a plethora of attacks. Specifically, Denial-ofService (DoS) attacks pose a serious threat in degrading the SoC performance by flooding the NoC with unnecessary packets.

A machine learning-based runtime monitoring mechanism to detect DoS attacks is presented here. The approach is capable of detecting DoS attacks with high accuracy, even in the presence of unpredictable NoC traffic patterns caused by various applications and application mappings. Extensive exploration of machine learning models and features were done to provide a comprehensive study on how to use machine learning for DoS attack detection in NoC-based SoCs.

The number of connected smart computing devices exceeds the human population, expecting over 50 billion devices to be deployed and mutually connected by 2025. Development of solutions are ranging from smartwatches, smart cars, smart homes, all the way to smart cities. We live in a time which is reigned by mutually connected devices.

## System-on-Chip

System-on-Chip (SoC) designs are at the heart of the computing devices, which range from simple IoT devices in smart homes to complex navigation systems in airplanes.

SoCs are in contrast to the common traditional motherboard-based PC architecture, whereas a motherboard houses and connects detachable or replaceable components, SoCs integrate all of these components into a single integrated circuit, as if all these functions were built into the motherboard.

The Broadcom BCM2835 SoC used in the first generation Raspberry Pi includes a 700 MHz ARM1176JZF-S processor, VideoCore IV graphics processing unit (GPU), and RAM.

</p>

A system on a chip (SoC) combines the required electronic circuits of various computer components onto a single, integrated chip (IC).

Modern SoC designs contain several highly sensitive assets such as encryption keys, device configurations, and on-device protected data that are responsible for keeping our personal, financial, and intimate physiological information safe and secure.

### Popular System-on-Chips

</p>

Today, System-on-Chips (SoCs) can be found in almost every smartphone and tablet.

### Why a SoC is different from a CPU?

<p align="center">

</p>

CPU is a very fast calculator. It fetches data from memory, and then performs some kind of arithmetic (add, multiply) or logical (and, or, not) operation on that data. It requires a whole framework of other silicon chips to perform the tasks of a computer. A memory to hold the data, an audio chip to decode and amplify music, a graphics processor to draw pictures on the monitor.

System-on-a-chip integrates almost all of these components into a single silicon chip. A SoC usually contains a GPU (a graphics processor), a memory, a USB controller, and power management circuits other than its processors.

A CPU cannot function without dozens of other chips, itâ€™s possible to build complete computers with just a single SoC.

### Why SoCs are preffered?

Needs less wiring than a CPU

Almost at the same size of a CPU.

Provides more functionality than a CPU.

In most instances, SoCs have a lesser power consumption.

Provides better design security at hardware and firmware levels.

### Intellectual Property Core Definition

</p>

An  Intellectual Property (IP) core in semiconductors is a reusable unit of logic or functionality or a cell or a layout design  that is normally developed  with the  idea of  licencing to multiple vendor for  using as building blocks in  different chip designs.

### Complexity and Challenges

<p align="center">

</p>

The drastic increase in SoC complexity has led to a significant increase in SoC design and validation complexity. This has challenged the verification of modern system-on-chip solutions and the increasing number of cores demands the use of a scalable on-chip interconnection architecture.

<p align="center"> 
<img src = "https://github.com/chamikasudusinghe/nocml/blob/master/%5B05%20-%20Resources%5D/07-vendors.PNG">
</p>

Reusable hardware IP based SoC design from various vendors has emerged as a pervasive design practice in the industry to dramatically reduce design and verification cost while meeting aggressive time-to-market constraints. These third-party IPs may come with deliberate malicious implants to incorporate undesired functionality .

## Network-on-Chip

<p align="center"> 
<img src = "https://github.com/chamikasudusinghe/nocml/blob/master/%5B05%20-%20Resources%5D/08-noc.PNG">
</p>

Network-on-Chip architecture is widely used to interconnect the Intellectual Property (IP) cores the System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. It uses a a packet based communication approach. 

NoC has allowed computer architects to fully utilize the computational power in an SoC by facilitating low-latency and high-throughput.

</p>

It is considered as an aggressive long-term approach for on-chip communications because it can deal well with the design issues of communication performance, power consumption, signal integrity, and system scalability.
