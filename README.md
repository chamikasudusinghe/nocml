# Denial-of-Service Attack Detection using MachineLearning in Network-on-Chip Architectures

This is a project focused on "Securing the NoC Using Machine Learning Based Anomaly Detection".

Encrypted Packet Monitoring Using ML

[dos ver 5.1] - Initial set of models run in the system againts dos attack with limited features. ##errorneous features are included here.

[dos ver 5.2] - Current set of models run in the system againts dos attack with all possible features atm. Results included.

[synth ver 1.1] - Current set of models run in the system againts eavesdropping attack with all possible features atm. Results included.

[design project] - Source files of models and data extraction for demonstrations.

[dos results ver 1] -  Simulation results and visualization for execution of FFT for 2 IPs (normal).

[dos results ver 2] -  Simulation results and visualization for execution of FFT for 8 IPs (normal).

[dos results ver 3] -  Results generation for 100 window

[dos results ver 4] -  Generated results foe the paper (for 1000 window)

log files are not included here due to large file size.
